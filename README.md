# Retail Sales & Inventory Analysis (MySQL + Power BI)

### 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **retail sales, customer behavior, staff performance, and inventory levels** using an end-to-end data analytics workflow.  
The objective is to convert raw transactional data into meaningful business insights that support **decision-making, forecasting, and performance tracking**.

## 🔍 1. Summary of the Project
This project involves designing a relational database in **MySQL**, performing data cleaning and transformation, creating reusable SQL Views for analysis, and visualizing insights using **Power BI**.

The project uses real-world retail datasets (Orders, Order Items, Customers, Staff, Products, Inventory, Stores).  
After structuring and cleaning the data, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard showing:

- Total Revenue, Orders, Customer Count  
- Sales by Store, Category, Staff  
- Inventory movement vs. sales demand  
- Regional sales distribution on a map  
- Yearly & Monthly sales trends

## ❓ 2. Business Problem

Retail managers struggle to:
- Identify which stores and staff drive maximum revenue
- Track stock availability and high-demand products
- Understand customer purchase trends and order patterns
- Make decisions backed by data instead of assumptions

The company needs a dashboard to answer:
- *Which product categories generate the highest revenue?*
- *Which stores perform better and why?*
- *Which staff members contribute the most in conversions?*
- *Are we maintaining enough inventory to meet demand?*
